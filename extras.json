      "ListItemDescription": "Despite an X-ray coming back negative on Monday, Millsap went ahead and scheduled a follow-up meeting with Nuggets doctors Tuesday, where it was decided it's in his best interest to undergo surgery on the wrist. The extent of the surgery is unclear at this point in time and the Nuggets aren't offering any sort of timetable for a return, so Millsap is going to be considered out indefinitely for the time being. A more concrete target date will likely be released following the surgery, but it wouldn't be surprising if he missed at least a month or two of action. Guys like Kenneth Faried, Juan Hernangomez and Trey Lyles should help cover his minutes, with Faried the likely starter moving forward. That said, Wilson Chandler has played some power forward in the past, so the Nuggets could experiment with him at the position as well, which could mean more Will Barton at small forward.",

Hornacek said afterward that the rookie had been fighting the flu for \"two, three days now,\" but the hope is that an off day Tuesday will be all Ntilikina needs to recover in time to play Wednesday against the Raptors. The 11 minutes were Ntilikina's fewest in any game since the season opener, but once he's healthy again, it's expected his playing time will tick back up at the expense of Sessions and Jarrett Jack.",

With Milos Teodosic (foot) still out, Thornwell could still be a part of the regular rotation, though he'll see a sizable decrease in minutes now that he's working with the reserves.",
