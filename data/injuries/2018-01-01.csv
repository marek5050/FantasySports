Johnson of the Chicago Tribune reports.","Dunn went through pregame warmups to test out the injury and apparently everything feels fine, as he's expected to start as usual. The Bulls aren't reporting any sort of restrictions on his workload, so season-long fantasy owners should feel comfortable activating him. That said, Dunn could be somewhat of a risky play in DFS contests due to the fact that he's fresh off an injury.

As a result of shooting 12.8 times per game for the season, Murray has improved his shooting numbers from year one to year two, shooting 44.4 percent this year compared to last year's 40.4 percent.

The guard broke a three-game scoring drought of 4.6 points per game on the strength of an efficient shooting performance.

Averaging 7.5 shots per game, Bayless set a new season-high shooting percentage in a games when he shot 10 or more times in a game.

He's  really outperforming previous career numbers from three-point range, as he's attempted an average of 4.3  threes per game in 36 games.  Gasol and the Grizzlies played well overall but ultimately couldn't completely contain the Warriors to keep things competitive, and Gasol's weak defensive numbers indicate that fact.

His solid play and efficient shooting (did not miss at the charity stripe or beyond the arc Saturday night) will continue to net him minutes on a star-studded team.

While he often plays second fiddle to Giannis Antetokounmpo, he's been on a recent 10-game tear, averaging 21.4 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.8 assists over that span.  Middleton's stat lines usually contribute in multiple categories, so he is a good candidate for production even on a below-average scoring night.",12/30/2017 12:20:51 AM,203114,G,3,3356,MIL,bucks,274097,12/30/2017 12:20:51 AM,khris_middleton
