0,1514536278,Jamal,Jamal Crawford: Scores 11 points Thursday,NO,Healthy,,,,,Crawford,Crawford scored 11 points in 26 minutes but was just 4-of-13 from the field and 0-for-5 from three-point range in Thursday’s loss at Milwaukee.,"Although he struggled with his shot, it's worth noting that Crawford played 26 minutes. His playing time off the bench has been increasing (he's averaging 23.4 minutes and 17 points in his last five games) and he could get even more minutes with Jeff Teague sidelined several weeks with a knee injury if the T-Wolves need more scoring. Crawford could be worth a look in deeper formats as a result.",12/28/2017 10:31:18 PM,2037,G,3,2067,MIN,timberwolves,274018,12/28/2017 10:31:18 PM,jamal_crawford

He was limited by a sprained right ankle in the third quarter, but he was able to return to action, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.","Wiggins was 0-for-3 from the field in the fourth quarter after having his ankle taped.

2,1514535280,Tyus,Tyus Jones: Five assists in move to starting lineup,NO,Healthy,,,,,Jones,"Jones started at point guard and scored six points with five assists, four rebounds and five steals in 35 minutes in Thursday’s loss at Milwaukee. He played through a dislocated left pinkie, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.","Jones was 0-for-2 from three-point range and 2-of-5 from the floor. He may not take many shots, but he should produce decent assist totals and defensive stats while getting significant minutes at point guard with Jeff Teague out with a knee injury. Teague may be out several weeks or more, so Jones should be a top free agent addition in most formats where available. Jones downplayed his hand injury after the game and since he was able to return to action, it's not likely to be a major problem.",12/28/2017 10:14:40 PM,1626145,G,3,3739,MIN,timberwolves,274016,12/28/2017 10:14:40 PM,tyus_jones

All of the veteran sharpshooter's points came from behind the arc, as he equaled a season high in made three-pointers.

The 17-year veteran has five straight double-digit scoring efforts and has encouragingly been able to tolerate minute totals in the low-to-high 20s over that span without any setbacks.

A high-water mark in visits to the charity stripe helped prop up his line significantly Thursday, as he'd scored no more than six points in his previous six contests. While the unexpected offensive surge was certainly a welcome sight for fantasy owners, Anderson's offensive contributions remain largely inconsistent, although his typically solid work on the glass and in the area of assists has helped keep him fantasy-viable even when his point totals remain in the single digits.",12/28/2017 7:57:08 PM,203937,F,3,3586,SAS,spurs,274013,12/28/2017 7:57:08 PM,kyle_anderson

The 37-year-old has been much more of an offensive factor since late November, as he's posted 10 double-digit scoring efforts in his last 14 games, with double-doubles in six of those contests. As long as Kawhi Leonard remains limited in playing time and continues to be rested altogether in certain games, Gasol's usage should remain elevated and have a corresponding effect on his fantasy value.",12/28/2017 7:46:51 PM,2200,C,3,2156,SAS,spurs,274012,12/28/2017 7:46:51 PM,pau_gasol

The 12-year veteran has scored at least 20 points in four of his last five games, while also hauling in between six and 14 rebounds in 10 of his last 11 contests. As long as Leonard continues to be rested intermittently and play limited minutes when he does take the floor, Aldridge should continue generating production of similar caliber.",12/28/2017 7:39:27 PM,200746,F,3,2502,SAS,spurs,274011,12/28/2017 7:39:27 PM,lamarcus_aldridge

The rookie has shown some modest offensive improvement in December with three-double-digit scoring efforts during the month. His shooting has also seen a corresponding uptick from 34.2 to 38.5 percent as compared to November, but he clearly has plenty of room for improvement in that area overall.",12/28/2017 7:28:07 PM,1628373,G,3,4128,NYK,knicks,274010,12/28/2017 7:28:07 PM,
9,1514525232,Robert,Robert Covington: Won't return Thursday,YES,GTD,,,Left,Finger,Covington,Covington has been ruled out for the remainder of Thursday’s game against the Trail Blazers with a left middle finger injury.,"Covington attempted just two field goals in 24 minutes of action before being forced out of Thursday's game with a finger injury in the third quarter. The specifics of the injury haven't been revealed, so it's too early to determine if he'll be able to suit up for Saturday's game against the Nuggets. We'll await official word regarding his status from the 76ers following the conclusion of Thursday's contest.",12/28/2017 7:27:12 PM,203496,F,2,3495,PHI,sixers,274009,12/28/2017 7:27:12 PM,robert_covington

The seven-year veteran has a pair of explosive double-doubles on his December resume, and he was also riding a four-game streak of double-digit rebounds coming into the game. His playing time does tend to fluctuate, however, which can wreak some havoc with the consistency of his overall production. However, despite some modest playing time, Kanter was still averaging a double-double of 13.4 points and 10.5 rebounds across just 25.7 minutes in 13 December contests prior to Thursday's outing.",12/28/2017 7:23:12 PM,202683,C,3,3188,NYK,knicks,274008,12/28/2017 7:23:12 PM,enes_kanter

Porzingis has also hauled in between five and nine rebounds in the last five contests and continues to serve as a prolific multi-category producer, as he's scored at least 18 points in eight of 10 December games as well.",12/28/2017 7:13:22 PM,204001,F,3,3669,NYK,knicks,274007,12/28/2017 7:13:22 PM,kristaps_porzingis

He only played 19 minutes but managed to get up 11 field-goal attempts in that time. He is going to be managed moving forward and could be rested on back-to-back sets so he is not really worth owning except in the deepest of leagues.,12/28/2017 7:11:15 PM,202694,F,3,3198,BOS,celtics,274006,12/28/2017 7:11:15 PM,marcus_morris

While still having himself a nice game, owners might have been hoping for more with Jeff Teague (knee) on the sidelines. Teague looks like he is going to miss extended time which means Butler is going to be handling the ball a bit more which could see an uptick in both his scoring and assists.",12/28/2017 7:07:54 PM,202710,G,3,3231,MIN,timberwolves,274005,12/28/2017 7:07:54 PM,jimmy_butler

The 32-year-old also drained multiple threes for the seventh time in the last eight games and came into Thursday's contest with career highs in scoring (13.4), rebounds (3.6) , assists (2.8) and steals (1.4). Given his sizable role in the Knicks' offense and consistent play, Lee's fantasy stock continues to rise in all formats.",12/28/2017 7:06:40 PM,201584,G,3,2970,NYK,knicks,274003,12/28/2017 7:06:40 PM,courtney_lee

It seems likely that he'll be able to return to the game at some point, though we'll have to wait and see if the injury turns out to be more serious than initially imagined.",12/28/2017 7:05:21 PM,203994,C,3,3580,POR,blazers,274002,12/28/2017 7:05:21 PM,jusuf_nurkic

Towns led the way with 22 points but only took 12 field-goal attempts. He has been better lately after a somewhat slow start to the season, however, owners would love to see him getting more involved in the offense. While he has been shooting the ball well from beyond the perimeter lately, he is also one of the best low-post players in the league. A few more touches inside could be coming with Jeff Teague (knee) set to miss some time, leaving the point-guard duties to Tyus Jones. While Jones is capable of running the team, he is not going to be looking for his own shot as much as Teague, which will mean Towns and Jimmy Butler will need to do more of the offensive work.",12/28/2017 7:04:50 PM,1626157,C,3,3741,MIN,timberwolves,274001,12/28/2017 7:04:50 PM,karl-anthony_towns

He has seen some of the offensive pressure shifted away from him with Eric Bledsoe taking up some of the slack. This has allowed his efficiency to increase to an amazing 54.5 percent from the field. He will look to get back to his old ways when the team travels to Oklahoma City to face the Thunder on Friday.",12/28/2017 6:59:04 PM,203507,F,3,3456,MIL,bucks,274000,12/28/2017 6:59:04 PM,giannis_antetokounmpo

The veteran's work on the glass equaled his best haul of the season as well and led to his second double-double within the last five games. Beasley's minutes continue to fluctuate between the teens and the mid-to-high 30s, however, so it's difficult to get a feel for his potential production from one game to the next.",12/28/2017 6:57:33 PM,201563,F,3,2935,NYK,knicks,273999,12/28/2017 6:57:33 PM,michael_beasley

Bledsoe continues to be an excellent fit next to Giannis Antetokounmpo and is playing the best basketball he has played in a number of seasons. Predictably, his scoring is down from last season, however, his defensive numbers have increased across the board. He is also starting to form some nice combinations with Malcolm Brogdon, who continues to see nice run off the bench. Things are trending up for the young team as they continue to make a push for a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference.",12/28/2017 6:54:23 PM,202339,G,3,3113,MIL,bucks,273998,12/28/2017 6:54:23 PM,eric_bledsoe

He played a team-high 40 minutes and contributed 24 points on 23 shot attempts. The Rockets were in control for most of the game before faltering in the final quarter to eventually fall to their fourth consecutive loss.

Harden once again put up some big numbers across the board but was only 7-of-27 from the field and turned the ball over eight times. He did make up for it with double-digit assists and 15-of-15 from the free-throw line. This is what you are going to get with Harden on a nightly basis. Chris Paul (leg) could return as soon as Friday against the Wizards which would send Harden back to the shooting guard position, however, it shouldn't really have an impact on his fantasy value and should even increase his efficiency.",12/28/2017 6:44:12 PM,201935,G,3,3018,HOU,rockets,273996,12/28/2017 6:44:12 PM,james_harden

His efficiency is always going to be the one major issue with his game, but he can help teams in many other ways. He was huge down the stretch matching up against James Harden, taking two crucial charges in the later stages of the game. He saw some additional run with Jaylen Brown on the sidelines but should be locked in for consistent minutes, even when Brown does eventually return.",12/28/2017 6:37:18 PM,203935,G,3,3575,BOS,celtics,273995,12/28/2017 6:37:18 PM,marcus_smart

He has been very good for his new team, sliding right in where Isaiah Thomas left out. He doesn't put up some of the gaudy numbers that players like James Harden and LeBron James do but remains a consistent top ten player. The Celtics have had some sub-par performances since their hot start to the season and hopefully, this win can be the start of another series of consecutive victories.

He continues to play well beyond his years and is arguably the Celtics most consistent player. On top of his scoring and efficiency, he is also collecting defensive numbers on a regular basis.

Miles: Drains six threes in Wednesday's loss,NO,Healthy,,,,,Miles,"Miles scored a team-high 20 points (6-12 FG, 6-12 3Pt, 2-2 FT) while adding a rebound and a steal in 22 minutes off the bench during Wednesday’s 124-107 loss to the Thunder.","On a night when DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry were shooting a combined 7-for-26 from the floor, Miles stepped up and provided the Raptors with an outside threat, making more three-pointers than the rest of the team combined. The veteran has had a bit of a rough start to his Toronto tenure, missing seven games already this season due to various minor injuries, but if he can stay healthy it wouldn't be a surprise to see him stay hot from beyond the arc.",12/28/2017 5:29:15 AM,101139,G,3,2627,TOR,raptors,273893,12/28/2017 5:29:15 AM,cj_miles

Yabusele, or should we say ""Dabusele,"" drained another three during the rookie's career-high 10 minutes of play. With Marcus Morris (knee), Jaylen Brown (knee) and Semi Ojeleye (back) all out, it was time for the energetic Frechman to hit the dance floor. While the post-three dance is always entertaining, coach Brad Stevens was probably happier with the three rebounds. Yabusele's minutes tonight versus the Rockets will probably once again depend on the health of his injured teammates. The Dancing Bear has only seen action in 15 games this season.",12/28/2017 5:20:02 AM,1627824,F,4,3932,BOS,celtics,273892,12/28/2017 5:20:02 AM,guerschon_yabusele

This was Horford's eighth double-double of the season. The 31-year-old veteran is averaging one full rebound more (7.8 per game) than last season. He'll look to keep the good times rolling versus the fast-paced Rockets tonight at TD Garden.",12/28/2017 4:51:13 AM,201143,C,3,2816,BOS,celtics,273891,12/28/2017 4:51:13 AM,al_horford

The guard led all Chicago scorers with 17 points and filled out his box score with five rebounds and five assists. Over his last five games, Dunn is averaging 12.8 points, 9.0 assists and 4.0 rebounds.
