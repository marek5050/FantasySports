The veteran guard has double-digit scoring efforts in four of his last five games and carries a blistering 59.4 percent success rate from the field in December -- including 58.7 percent from three-point range -- into Saturday's contest against the Knicks.",12/30/2017 9:12:54 AM,202734,G,3,3227,NOP,pelicans,274143,12/30/2017 9:12:54 AM,etwaun_moore

The veteran guard is enjoying a particularly strong month from the field, with Friday's 58.3 percent success rate his third of well over 50.0 percent in the last four games and eighth overall in December. Factoring in Friday's effort, he's averaging a fantasy-friendly line of 22.2 points, 4.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.0 blocks over 37.2 minutes in 14 December contests.",12/30/2017 9:08:29 AM,201950,G,3,3029,NOP,pelicans,274142,12/30/2017 9:08:29 AM,jrue_holiday

The 24-year-old is in the midst of an especially successful stretch from the floor, as he's shot at least 52.4 percent in six of the last seven games and is posting a 56.5 percent success rate overall in December. As long as his often fickle health endures, Davis naturally retains a spot as an elite fantasy option across all formats.",12/30/2017 9:00:41 AM,203076,F,3,3297,NOP,pelicans,274141,12/30/2017 9:00:41 AM,anthony_davis

The perennial All-Star has double-doubles in four of his last five games and has taken his usage to another level in his last pair of contests, putting up a total of 44 shot attempts in those games on his way to an average of 29.5 points. Cousins continues to seamlessly co-exist with fellow superstar Anthony Davis in the Pelicans' frontcourt, rendering both of them top-shelf options in any format.",12/30/2017 8:56:44 AM,202326,C,2,3098,NOP,pelicans,274140,12/30/2017 8:56:44 AM,demarcus_cousins

While his scoring totals fluctuate due to his bench role, the fourth-year big man remains efficient on a per-minute basis the majority of nights, with his solid work on the glass (career-high 4.8 rebounds through 36 games) serving as an excellent supplement to his overall production.",12/30/2017 8:52:28 AM,203939,F,3,3610,DAL,mavericks,274139,12/30/2017 8:52:28 AM,dwight_powell

The 12-year veteran has eight double-digit scoring efforts in the last 11 games, and he's dished out between six and 12 dimes in nine of his last 10 contests as well. With his ability consistently offer multi-category production and typically high usage, Barea retains solid fantasy value across all formats, irrespective of his bench role.",12/30/2017 8:48:30 AM,200826,G,3,2775,DAL,mavericks,274138,12/30/2017 8:48:30 AM,jose_barea

Harris is shooting 56.0 percent (14-for-25) over the last four games overall, although Friday's game featured a particularly aggressive approach on his part from three-point range. The 14-year veteran remains capable of producing a double-digit scoring tally and offering serviceable rebounding and assists numbers on any given night, making him a viable option in deeper formats and as a low-cost DFS punt play.",12/30/2017 8:44:58 AM,2734,G,3,2468,DAL,mavericks,274137,12/30/2017 8:44:58 AM,devin_harris

Matthews has had the hot hand over the last two games as well, draining 12 of his 21 shots during that span, including five of 11 from three-point range. After a pair of sub-40 percent shooting campaigns in his first two years in Dallas, Matthews has bounced back to produce a 40.1 percent figure through the first 37 games of the current campaign that nevertheless still has plenty of room for improvement.",12/30/2017 8:40:46 AM,202083,G,3,3057,DAL,mavericks,274136,12/30/2017 8:40:46 AM,wesley_matthews

Nowitzki has been especially active on the boards as of late, hauling in between six and 12 rebounds in the last four contests while recording at least one block in each of those games as well. December has represented his best stretch of the campaign thus far, as he's averaging 13.7 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists across a modest 26.3 minutes heading into the final game of the month against the Thunder on Sunday.",12/30/2017 8:36:11 AM,1717,F,3,1895,DAL,mavericks,274133,12/30/2017 8:36:11 AM,dirk_nowitzki

Smith became the third-youngest player in NBA history to accomplish a triple-double, with Lonzo Ball and LeBron James the only two that beat him to the punch. The dynamic 20-year-old snapped a four-game streak of single-digit point totals with Friday's effort, and the five made three-pointers also equaled a career high. While he's bound to continue seeing the occasional ups and downs typical for a first-year player, Smith's Friday performance served as tangible evidence of his considerable fantasy upside.",12/30/2017 8:31:54 AM,1628372,G,2,4109,DAL,mavericks,274132,12/30/2017 8:31:54 AM,

However, the third-year pro managed to maximize his modest allotment of minutes, posting his ninth double-digit scoring effort of December in the process. Despite the fact that Portis has seen under 20 minutes in six games during the month, he's still sporting solid averages of 12.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 14 games overall.",12/30/2017 8:26:16 AM,1626171,F,3,3705,CHI,bulls,274130,12/30/2017 8:26:16 AM,bobby_portis

The 28-year-old guard has seen the occasional scoring downturn recently due to some shooting struggles, but he's fought through those at times by continuing to put the ball up and also remaining efficient from the charity stripe. Factoring in Friday's production, he's averaging 11.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals across 32.7 minutes heading into the final contest of December against the Wizards on Sunday.",12/30/2017 8:22:09 AM,203200,G,3,3242,CHI,bulls,274128,12/30/2017 8:22:09 AM,justin_holiday

The 25-year-old came within just a trio of boards of a triple-double and managed his third double-digit scoring effort in the last six games overall. Grant has flashed a hot hand from the field throughout December, as he's now shooting 50.5 percent, including 40.0 percent from three-point range, in 15 contests during the month. With Dunn not slated to practice Saturday and already questionable for Sunday's game against the Wizards, there's a strong possibility that Grant will have a second consecutive run with the first team to close out the month and calendar year.",12/30/2017 8:18:37 AM,1626170,G,3,3649,CHI,bulls,274127,12/30/2017 8:18:37 AM,jerian_grant

Mirotic is combining with rookie Lauri Markkanen and fellow reserve Bobby Portis to give the Bulls one of the deepest power forward rotations in the league, and he's also rewarding fantasy owners with strong work on the glass thus far. Factoring in Friday's production, he's averaging 7.3 rebounds to go along with his 18.1 points across just 25.7 minutes per game.",12/30/2017 8:14:28 AM,202703,F,3,3218,CHI,bulls,274125,12/30/2017 8:14:28 AM,nikola_mirotic

Markkanen has seen his scoring go through some ups and downs recently due to some ragged shooting nights, but Friday's effort marked his second tally of 64.7 percent from the field in the last five games. The 20-year-old also equaled a career high with five made three-pointers and is averaging 15.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 1.1 assists over 12 December contests heading into the final game of the month Sunday against the Wizards.",12/30/2017 8:10:26 AM,1628374,F,3,4119,CHI,bulls,274124,12/30/2017 8:10:26 AM,

Factoring in Friday's tally, Young has now generated single-digit point totals in five of his last seven games. The downturn has led to a notably lower 10.4 points per game average across 14 December contests than the 13.1 figure he managed in November. However, the veteran big man has managed to continue providing solid returns in rebounds and steals in particular, and moreover, his offensive decline appears to be in direct correlation to nothing more worrisome than a simple reduction in shot attempts; after putting up 12.1 shots per contest in November, Young is attempting a modest 9.1 field goals in the current month.",12/30/2017 8:06:20 AM,201152,F,3,2827,IND,pacers,274122,12/30/2017 8:06:20 AM,thaddeus_young

His trademark rim protecting prowess was on display as well, as he recorded multiple blocks for seventh time in the last nine games. Turner has stepped it up on the offensive end in particular during December, averaging 15.1 points on 51.3 percent shooting, both notable improvements over the respective 13.4 and 46.5 percent figures he generated in November.",12/30/2017 7:56:06 AM,1626167,C,3,3725,IND,pacers,274120,12/30/2017 7:56:06 AM,myles_turner

He ended up re-aggravating the ankle in one of the games. He attempted to play once more, but it was determined the injury was too bothersome for him to be on the floor. As a result, he's being held out for the foreseeable future to rest and recover. In his stead, Jonathon Simmons will seemingly continue seeing the bulk of the minutes at small forward.
