0,1511536667,CJ,CJ Miles: Not with team Friday,YES,Out,,,,Personal,Miles,Miles is listed as out in the Raptors’ game notes for Friday’s matchup with the Pacers due to personal reasons.,"The fact that Miles is not with the team Friday does not bode well for his status Saturday with the Raptors traveling to Atlanta, but he should still be considered questionable until Toronto can provide an official update on Miles. With Miles out, minutes will open up on the wing for both Normal Powell and rookie OG Anunoby.",11/24/2017 5:17:47 AM,101139,G,3,2627,TOR,raptors,270600,11/24/2017 5:17:47 AM,cj_miles
1,1511500970,Elfrid,Elfrid Payton: Collects second double-double of the season,NO,Healthy,,,,,Payton,"Payton totaled 10 points (4-9 FG, 0-3 3Pt, 2-7 FT), 13 assists, four rebounds, two steals and one block in 34 minutes during Wednesday’s 124-118 loss to the Timberwolves.","Payton struggled with his shot against Minnesota, but made up for it by contributing across the board. He looks fully recovered from his hamstring injury, playing a season-high 34 minutes in the loss. While his assist and steal numbers have been nice, he has been terrible from the free-throw line, shooting just 33 percent over his last three games. He has also only shot 35 percent from the floor over the same period. While he is not a high volume scorer, these numbers will have a negative effect on your team, so should be monitored over the next few games.",11/23/2017 7:22:50 PM,203901,G,3,3594,ORL,magic,270599,11/23/2017 7:22:50 PM,elfrid_payton

He has been excellent so far this season, but has slowed down after his amazing start. Parallel to his form, the Magic have also regressed after their hot start, losing their last six consecutive games. Along with Aaron Gordon, Vucevic has added a three-point shot to his arsenal. This looks like it is here to stay, and something owners can rely on for the rest of the season.",11/23/2017 7:17:26 PM,202696,C,3,3212,ORL,magic,270598,11/23/2017 7:17:26 PM,nikola_vucevic

Gordon has had some inconsistencies in his game this season, but for the most part, has looked like the player owners had been hoping for. His scoring and rebounding are right where they should be, however, it would be nice to see his defensive numbers come up slightly. His three-point shooting has been a nice addition to his game. While his efficiency from beyond the arc is likely not sustainable, he clearly has the green light to put the ball up whenever he likes.",11/23/2017 7:09:22 PM,203932,F,3,3577,ORL,magic,270597,11/23/2017 7:09:22 PM,aaron_gordon

Out of all the players who switched teams during the off-season, Teague appears to have settled in the quickest. His numbers have not really taken a hit, and in fact, his defensive numbers have actually improved. He is shooting the ball below his career mark, so that could come up at any stage, leaving him as a solid fantasy option in all formats. Those people who took him in the middle rounds of their draft, have to be pleasantly surprised.",11/23/2017 7:03:50 PM,201952,G,3,3025,MIN,timberwolves,270596,11/23/2017 7:03:50 PM,jeff_teague

Towns has been solid this season, but appears to have taken a back seat on the offensive pecking order. He has only averaged 11 field-goal attempts over the last four games, well down from his 18 he was attempting last season. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues, or whether it is simply a feeling out period for his new teammates. It is something to keep an eye on for owners, and if it does indeed continue, it could slightly limit his fantasy ceiling.",11/23/2017 6:56:43 PM,1626157,C,3,3741,MIN,timberwolves,270595,11/23/2017 6:56:43 PM,karl-anthony_towns

Gibson has been a nice fit for his new team, and has sneaky value in most fantasy formats. He will not blow you out of the water with his numbers, but can contribute across the board while maintaining good efficiency. He should really be owned in all leagues, until further notice.",11/23/2017 6:50:39 PM,201959,F,3,3035,MIN,timberwolves,270594,11/23/2017 6:50:39 PM,taj_gibson

The Hawks have failed to provide a specific update on his recovery, so he will continue being considered day-to-day going forward. With fellow power forward Luke Babbitt (back) also set to miss Friday's contest, rookie John Collins figures to be the prime candidate to start at power forward.",11/23/2017 4:47:46 PM,203488,C,3,3463,ATL,hawks,270593,11/23/2017 4:47:46 PM,mike_muscala

He sustained the injury in Monday's loss to the Clippers. Rookie John Collins replaced him at power forward in the starting lineup Wednesday, and will presumably be the favorite to do so again. Babbitt's next opportunity to return will be Saturday versus the Raptors.",11/23/2017 4:42:52 PM,202337,F,3,3106,ATL,hawks,270592,11/23/2017 4:42:52 PM,luke_babbitt

Prior to the injury, the 29-year-old had strung together three straight double-digit scoring efforts, while averaging 6.0 rebounds per game during that span.",11/23/2017 2:15:12 PM,202344,F,3,3142,BKN,nets,270591,11/23/2017 2:15:12 PM,trevor_booker

His minutes have remained consistent through the first 16 games, but his output can be a bit under-the-radar due to players like Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram taking up the spotlight in Los Angeles.  While he is widely owned in seasonal leagues, he is an intriguing GPP option and can also be utilized as a cheap option in cash games, depending on the matchup.",11/23/2017 11:14:00 AM,203484,G,3,3450,LAL,lakers,270590,11/23/2017 11:14:00 AM,kentavious_caldwell-pope

Bender's minutes total was easily a season high, while his rebound haul was his best since Oct. 28 against the Trail Blazers. The 20-year-old has been a solid source of rebounds all season, but it remains if his recent scoring uptick will endure.",11/23/2017 11:06:44 AM,1627733,F,3,3864,PHX,suns,270589,11/23/2017 11:06:44 AM,dragan_bender

Ulis' shot attempts are typically in the single digits, keeping his offensive contributions decidedly capped on most nights. However, he continues to retain a hold of the starting point guard job for the time being and has been offering solid rebounding, assist and steal totals for his fantasy owners.",11/23/2017 11:02:36 AM,1627755,G,3,3866,PHX,suns,270588,11/23/2017 11:02:36 AM,tyler_ulis

The 24-year-old has been notably more aggressive in his fourth season, averaging career-high 15.6 shot attempts, 6.2 rebounds and 18.7 points over his first 19 contests.",11/23/2017 10:57:30 AM,203933,F,3,3585,PHX,suns,270587,11/23/2017 10:57:30 AM,tj_warren

The 27-year-old big man can offer plenty off the bench, although the Suns will have to sort out minutes between him and Alex Len behind Tyson Chandler for the time being. If he's afforded sufficient playing time, Monroe is a threat for a double-double on any given night.",11/23/2017 10:52:19 AM,202328,C,3,3108,PHX,suns,270586,11/23/2017 10:52:19 AM,greg_monroe

The 21-year-old did shoot just 33.3 percent for the second straight contest and has been inconsistent from the field in November, posting a sub-40 percent success rate in five of 12 November contests. However, Booker is shooting a career-best 44.3 percent over his first 19 games, including a high-water mark of 37.1 percent from behind the arc.",11/23/2017 10:47:27 AM,1626164,G,3,3711,PHX,suns,270585,11/23/2017 10:47:27 AM,devin_booker

The fifth-year guard has provided modest scoring totals the majority of the season, but he's shooting a career-best 51.9 percent overall, including 46.2 percent from three-point range.",11/23/2017 10:40:50 AM,203503,G,3,3465,MIL,bucks,270584,11/23/2017 10:40:50 AM,tony_snell

The second-year swingman's scoring totals had been down over the prior two games while shooting just 2-for-13 from the field, but he's capable of solid performances the likes of Wednesday's any time he sees enough minutes. However, he's been relegated to the bench recently in favor of Tony Snell at shooting guard, but it remains to be seen if that arrangement will persist over the long term.",11/23/2017 10:34:12 AM,1627763,G,3,3898,MIL,bucks,270583,11/23/2017 10:34:12 AM,malcolm_brogdon

Maker has been seeing at least 20 minutes with regularity for the majority of November, but he'd yet to hit double digits in the scoring column this season until Wednesday's performance. While he doesn't typically offer much offensively, he's been a solid source of rebounds and blocks for those owning him in deeper formats.",11/23/2017 10:28:26 AM,1627748,F,3,3860,MIL,bucks,270582,11/23/2017 10:28:26 AM,thon_maker

The seven-year veteran was frequently booed by his former home fans, and with good reason, as Bledsoe frequently penetrated the Suns defense on his way to the second-highest scoring total for Milwaukee on the night. The 27-year-old has produced double-digit scoring efforts in six of his first seven games in his new digs, leaving to averages of 14.7 points, 4.9 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals.",11/23/2017 10:19:36 AM,202339,G,3,3113,MIL,bucks,270581,11/23/2017 10:19:36 AM,eric_bledsoe

His four free throws over the final six seconds of overtime sealed the hard-fought road win for the Bucks as well, capping off a masterful performance in which he took on a much larger offensive role in the absence of Giannis Antetokunmpo (knee). Middleton typically provides more modest scoring totals when Antetokounmpo is in the lineup, but he remains an above-average source of scoring, rebounds and assists even when sharing the floor with the latter.",11/23/2017 10:13:56 AM,203114,G,3,3356,MIL,bucks,270580,11/23/2017 10:13:56 AM,khris_middleton

Adams has three straight double-digit scoring efforts and also accomplished the feat in six of his previous nine contests. Even while sharing the floor with his high-usage teammates, Adams is averaging career bests in points (12.9 points) and shooting (65.8 percent) while also establishing a new high-water mark in rebounds (8.2).",11/23/2017 10:04:35 AM,203500,C,3,3445,OKC,thunder,270579,11/23/2017 10:04:35 AM,steven_adams

However, he's actually accomplished the figure while scuffling with his shot, as the 33-year-old only has an underwhelming 38.8 percent success rate from the field during the current month. Anthony's shot attempts per game (16.6) are understandably down from his Knicks heyday, but he remains a valuable source of scoring and rebounding in all fantasy formats.",11/23/2017 9:54:04 AM,2546,F,3,2351,OKC,thunder,270577,11/23/2017 9:54:04 AM,carmelo_anthony

Westbrook's scoring total was a season high, and he started building on it right from tip-off. He compiled 11 points, five rebounds and five assists in the first quarter and continued to posted his second consecutive double-digit rebound total in the process. While his numbers have notably been down across the board this season with the arrival of Paul George and Carmelo Anthony, Westbrook has started to pick up his scoring, as he's supplied at least 20 points in seven of the last nine contests.",11/23/2017 9:47:21 AM,201566,G,3,2932,OKC,thunder,270576,11/23/2017 9:47:21 AM,russell_westbrook

His respective 46.6 percent and 33.3 percent success rates from the field and three-point range are his best since the 2015-16 season, while his 78.3 percent free-throw shooting is his highest since his rookie 2012-13 campaign.",11/23/2017 9:40:49 AM,203110,F,3,3299,GSW,warriors,270575,11/23/2017 9:40:49 AM,draymond_green

Hood's fantasy value has been complicated by a combination of new teammate Ricky Rubio and the excellent play of Mitchell. Hood saw one start last week when Mitchell shifted to the point but it appears that a Rubio/Mitchell backcourt will be the new normal, leaving Hood to provide less fantasy value with the second unit.

That said, he's struggled to find playing time this season and can likely be ignored in most fantasy formats.",11/22/2017 9:10:20 AM,1627834,C,3,3927,SAC,kings,270472,11/22/2017 9:10:20 AM,george_papagiannis

Booker has started at center the last three games and should do so again if he's ultimately cleared. For now, he can be considered a game-time call and he may have to test out the ankle during pregame warmups before a final decision is made.",11/22/2017 8:34:52 AM,202344,F,3,3142,BKN,nets,270471,11/22/2017 8:34:52 AM,trevor_booker
