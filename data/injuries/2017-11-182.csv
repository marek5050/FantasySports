More word on his status should arrive closer to tipoff. But, if he's able to play, it would likely mean fewer minutes for Raul Neto.

He's been playing a significant role on the Hawks this year, posting 6.2 points and 2.4 assists across 16.1 minutes per game.

Apparently, morning shootaround didn't go as well as anticipated, however, as he's been downgraded from probable to questionable.
