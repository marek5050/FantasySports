Portis might have seen more time due to Lauri Markannen's struggles on the court but he accumulated five fouls and logged only 25 minutes.  Portis has played serviceably since his return from injury, but Markannen has pushed him out of the starting five indefinitely.

There seems to be some optimism surrounding Batum's questionable tag, but given that it is the same elbow that kept Batum out for several weeks to start the season, it's possible the team chooses to exercise caution.

Lopez and Bobby Portis were the only bright spots to speak of under the basket, as Luis Markkanen had a horrible outing and Denzel Valentine was even less effective. The nine-year veteran brings much-needed experience and leadership to this young team and despite their recent woes, Lopez has shown decent production, averaging 13.4 points and 5.4 rebounds over the first 16 games of the season.",11/23/2017 8:38:52 AM,201577,C,3,2919,CHI,bulls,270558,11/23/2017 8:38:52 AM,robin_lopez

Hood's fantasy value has been complicated by a combination of new teammate Ricky Rubio and the excellent play of Mitchell. Hood saw one start last week when Mitchell shifted to the point but it appears that a Rubio/Mitchell backcourt will be the new normal, leaving Hood to provide less fantasy value with the second unit.  Hood will have to string together similar stat lines and more usage to be completely reliable in any format, but he's still widely owned. He should warrant some consideration, especially if Mitchell's shot continues to fail him.",11/23/2017 8:20:29 AM,203918,G,3,3591,UTA,jazz,270557,11/23/2017 8:20:29 AM,rodney_hood

He's executing effectively on both sides of the ball and is averaging 15.9 points, 9.1 rebounds and 1.6 blocks across seven games since Gobert's injury.  With no clear timetable for Gobert's return, Favors becomes a must-add target and a rosterable player for at least the next month.",11/23/2017 8:08:46 AM,202324,F,3,3107,UTA,jazz,270556,11/23/2017 8:08:46 AM,derrick_favors

The forward was also efficient from the floor, hitting 57.1 percent of his shots as well as 2-of-3 from beyond the arc. Wednesday's scoring performance aside, do not expect Gay to lead the Spurs offense on a nightly basis.

Aldridge, who is averaging 21.9 points, is very much off to a solid start as the focal point of the San Antonio offense in the absence of Tony Parker (quadriceps) and Kawhi Leonard (quadriceps). The power forward will look to bounce back Saturday against a middling Charlotte defense that gives up an average of 106.5 points per game.",11/23/2017 3:46:04 AM,200746,F,3,2502,SAS,spurs,270554,11/23/2017 3:46:04 AM,lamarcus_aldridge

The fact that a line like this is deemed a quiet night, speaks volumes about how good he has been this season. He appears to be fitting in well next to Chris Paul, who continues to ramp up his playing time. There is no reason to believe Harden cannot put up numbers similar to last season, apart from taking a hit to his assists total.

He has his shot going tonight, albeit against a lackluster Dever defense. He played right on his minutes restriction of 28 minutes, and this is a great sign for owners given the nature of the scoreline.

With Paul Millsap (wrist) set to miss an extended period of time, Barton is in a prime position to cash in with more playing time. While his numbers looked good however, he did have a plus/minus rating of -42, the worst on the team.

The playmaking should come as no surprise though, as Griffin's five assists per game this season marks a career-high. That sort of production should only continue from here, as the Clippers will now be without Patrick Beverley (knee) for the remainder of the year. The only gripe fantasy owners can have are his rebounds (7.9) and field goal percentage (41.7%), which both mark career-lows. While the rebounds may remain the same, his field goal percentage is more than 75 points below his second-lowest total, as he's due for some positive regression there.",11/23/2017 12:18:39 AM,201933,F,3,3016,LAC,clippers,270550,11/23/2017 12:18:39 AM,blake_griffin

Over his last four games, Johnson is averaging 15.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 2.0 blocks and 1.8 steals per game. The most important stat is the fact that he's playing nearly 34 minutes per game in that four-game span.

The free-throw shooting has been a nice development for Jordan this year, as his 61 percent mark from the line is the best of his career. While it's nothing special, it adds so much to his fantasy value, as this was a guy who couldn't even crack 44 percent for his career. If he can remain above 60 percent, Jordan is one of the values of fantasy drafts",11/23/2017 12:08:50 AM,201599,C,3,2929,LAC,clippers,270548,11/23/2017 12:08:50 AM,deandre_jordan

Not to mention, the fact that Patrick Beverley is out for the year due to a knee injury obviously played in that decision as well, as this is one of the thinnest backcourts in the NBA. Whether he comes off the bench or not, Williams will play 30 minutes a game and run this offense as one of the only playmakers on this roster.",11/23/2017 12:04:08 AM,101150,G,3,2633,LAC,clippers,270547,11/23/2017 12:04:08 AM,louis_williams

He has now scored in double figures in five-straight games, as he's played at least 36 minutes in back-to-back games as well. That's an extremely promising sign, as those two games both marked career-highs.

With that said, Belinelli has turned into one of the best scorers off the bench in the league, as he's averaging 12.1 points per game. That's pretty much all he'll provide for fantasy though, as his upside is limited with his lack of peripheral statistics.",11/22/2017 11:54:33 PM,201158,G,3,2826,ATL,hawks,270545,11/22/2017 11:54:33 PM,marco_belinelli

What has fallen off recently is the rebounding though, as he has just 11 rebounds over his last five games. That's quite the fall off, considering he's currently setting a career-low with 3.4 rebounds per game. His steals are also down, as he's setting a career-low in that category as well with just 1.1 thefts per game.

It comes at a strange time too, as he was averaging just 8.3 points and 8.3 rebounds across his previous three games. That's just the nature of owning Howard though, as it's all a matter of motivation with the volatile center. In any case, his 15.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game make for a nice bounce-back season, as he remains a great fantasy option at center.",11/22/2017 11:44:20 PM,2730,C,3,2458,CHA,hornets,270543,11/22/2017 11:44:20 PM,dwight_howard

It could continue too, as Batum reportedly re-aggravated that injury in this win, thus moving Lamb back into the starting small forward role.  That immediately makes Lamb relevant again in all formats, as he'll be one of the biggest pickups of the week depending on the Batum news that should be coming shortly. It's not like he's completely irrelevant as a bench player either, with Lamb averaging 19 points across his last three games.",11/22/2017 11:38:49 PM,203087,G,3,3319,CHA,hornets,270542,11/22/2017 11:38:49 PM,jeremy_lamb

He now has at least 20 points in six of his last seven games, as he continues to run this offense, What makes Walker all the more intriguing is the status of Nicolas Batum, as he appeared to re-aggravate his elbow injury in this win.
