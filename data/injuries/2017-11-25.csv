The 23-year-old big man's layup and subsequent made free throw with 27 seconds remaining snapped a 123-123 tie and afforded the Blazers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. Nurkic now has consecutive double-doubles for the first time this season and is remaining heavily involved in the offense, taking double-digit shot attempts in seven of his last eight contests.
