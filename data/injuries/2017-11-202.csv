It appears Millsap has avoided anything serious, though the sprain could still cost him multiple games. Following Monday's contest, Millsap's next opportunity to return will be Wednesday against the Rockets, though his availability for that contest is not yet known.",11/20/2017 11:20:20 AM,200794,F,3,2705,DEN,nuggets,270328,11/20/2017 11:20:20 AM,paul_millsap

He was able to partake in practice Monday without any issues, so look for Chandler to return to the lineup on Wednesday barring any setbacks. That said, with Greg Monroe playing well as a fill-in center and the presence of Alex Len, the center rotation is a bit unclear at this point in time, so it may be wise to avoid the situation until some clarity is provided.",11/20/2017 9:55:14 AM,2199,C,3,2158,PHX,suns,270326,11/20/2017 9:55:14 AM,tyson_chandler

With the Nuggets heading into the second night of a back-to-back, that didn't give Millsap enough time to make a recovery and he'll now be held out to avoid putting any additional strain on his wrist. With Millsap out, Kenneth Faried and Juancho Hernangomez should see a bump in playing time in the frontcourt.

I don’t think he’ll play today, Wednesday or Saturday. Again, it’s how he feels. There haven’t been any setbacks or major problems. It just takes time when it’s a stress reaction.”","Carlisle's words certainly don't inspire a ton of optimism, and it looks as though Curry's absence will likely extend into early December. Expect Wes Matthews, J.J. Barea, Devin Harris, Dennis Smith, and Yogi Ferrell to continue to shoulder the bulk of the workload in the backcourt in Curry's absence.

Lyles parlayed the extra minutes into his second double-digit scoring effort of the campaign, along with a season-high rebound tally. Despite the encouraging performance, Lyles' typically minuscule role keeps his fantasy value depressed, although he could certainly see a boost in playing time if Millsap's injury lingers.",11/20/2017 6:40:52 AM,1626168,F,3,3738,DEN,nuggets,270308,11/20/2017 6:40:52 AM,trey_lyles

The 24-year-old has managed double-digit point totals in seven of his last eight contests, but he's also notably improved in non-scoring categories this season. Factoring in Sunday's production, he's averaging career highs in rebounds (5.2), assists (2.6), steals (1.6) and blocks (0.5), bumping up his fantasy stock across all formats.",11/20/2017 6:32:00 AM,203484,G,3,3450,LAL,lakers,270307,11/20/2017 6:32:00 AM,kentavious_caldwell-pope

Lopez has shot 56.7 percent (17-for-30) over the last two games, including 45.5 percent (5-for-11) from three-point range. The 10-year veteran has been good for an occasional double-double as well, and he's recorded multiple blocks in 11 contests overall.",11/20/2017 6:26:22 AM,201572,C,3,2918,LAL,lakers,270306,11/20/2017 6:26:22 AM,brook_lopez

The 25-year-old guard has scored in double digits in eight of 10 November contests, and given his role as a critical source of scoring off the bench, his aforementioned clunker can safely be considered an outlier.",11/20/2017 6:16:11 AM,203903,G,3,3614,LAL,lakers,270304,11/20/2017 6:16:11 AM,jordan_clarkson

The point guard, who played through a sore left shoulder and sprained ankle earlier this season, recently indicated that he received intravenous fluids to aid his recovery from an illness, which then  resulted in swelling in the knee that later became soreness. Wizards head coach Scott Brooks characterized the decision to hold Wall out Sunday as ""just playing it safe"" with the team opening a stretch of three games in four nights, following up that there's a ""great chance"" the three-time All-Star will be back on the court for the second half of the back-to-back set. If Wall does in fact suit up, Tim Frazier, who finished with six points, eight rebounds and eight assists in 36 minutes Sunday, would likely slide back into a lower-minute bench role.",11/20/2017 6:15:19 AM,202322,G,1,3097,WAS,wizards,270303,11/20/2017 6:15:19 AM,john_wall

The 2014 first-round pick has shot 60.7 percent (17-for-28) from the field over the last pair of games and has been excellent on the glass all month, averaging 7.7 rebounds in 10 November contests. Given his secure role in the frontcourt rotation and multi-category production, Randle's fantasy stock appears to be on the rise.",11/20/2017 6:12:44 AM,203944,F,3,3574,LAL,lakers,270302,11/20/2017 6:12:44 AM,julius_randle

With an exceptional 46.7 percent mark from 3-point land on the season, Teletovic should have a spot waiting for him in the Bucks' rotation once he's healthy, but it's unclear if he's on track to return at any point during the team's three-game week.",11/20/2017 6:09:33 AM,203141,F,3,3398,MIL,bucks,270301,11/20/2017 6:09:33 AM,mirza_teletovic

He also joined Magic Johnson as the only Lakers player to have multiple triple-doubles in his rookie season and represented his first double-digit scoring effort since Nov. 11. Ball's shooting continues to be an issue on most nights, but he's encouragingly posted a 40.0 percent success rate over his last two games, a figure that still leaves plenty of room for improvement but is markedly better than the 29.6 percent success rate he's managed in 10 November games overall.",11/20/2017 6:07:35 AM,,G,3,4110,LAL,lakers,270300,11/20/2017 6:07:35 AM,

The reserve center was thrust into extended action due to Nikola Jokic's second-quarter ejection, and although he endured a rough night from the charity stripe, he provided some outstanding supplementary production due to a season-best four blocks.

The veteran guard had only taken five shot attempts in that contest, but he was back up to his normal usage levels Sunday.

129,1511076835,Dennis,Dennis Schroder: Provides 23 points and nine assists against Boston,NO,Healthy,,,,,Schroder,"Schroder collected 23 points (9-18 FG, 3-3 FT), two rebounds, nine assists and two steals in a 110-99 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday.","Schroder has been in a minor slump over the last two weeks, as this breakout is a fantastic sign against an elite Boston defense. Many fantasy owners were worried about their field goal percentage when they drafted Schroder, but the fact that he's shooting at a 45 percent clip has to make owners ecstatic. If he can continue to provide his 19.9 points, 6.8 assists and 1,2 steals per game averages with that sort of percentage, Schroder will surely reach top-40 value.",11/18/2017 9:33:55 PM,203471,G,3,3444,ATL,hawks,270198,11/18/2017 9:33:55 PM,dennis_schroder
