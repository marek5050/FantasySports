0,1515101939,Briante,Briante Weber: Acts as backup point guard Wednesday,NO,Healthy,,,,,Weber,"Weber finished with two points (1-4 FG, 0-1 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists across 16 minutes in Wednesday’s 116-98 win over the Magic.","With James Harden (hamstring) expected to miss anywhere from 2-to-6 weeks due to the injury he suffered on New Year's Eve, Weber looks like he'll be one of several players to benefit from increased minutes. The 25-year-old acted as the primary backup to starting point guard Chris Paul on Wednesday, with third-string option Bobby Brown logging a lone minute in garbage time. A 39.8 percent career shooter, Weber doesn't offer much upside on the offensive end, but his on-ball defense could be enough to keep him ahead of Brown in the rotation.",1/04/2018 11:38:59 AM,1627362,G,4,3811,HOU,rockets,274593,1/04/2018 11:38:59 AM,briante_weber

Though his status as a player signed to a two-way contract naturally limits Buycks' longevity with the team, the Pistons would likely be willing to sign the 28-year-old to a regular contract if his play warrants him sticking around once he's exhausted his 45 days at the NBA level.",1/04/2018 11:14:45 AM,202779,G,4,3534,DET,pistons,274592,1/04/2018 11:14:45 AM,dwight_buycks

He'll likely test out the shoulder one last time during Friday morning shootaround, and if everything checks out, the assumption would be that Ball will be good to go against Charlotte.",1/04/2018 10:40:33 AM,1628366,G,2,4110,LAL,lakers,274591,1/04/2018 10:40:33 AM,
3,1515097658,Langston,Langston Galloway: Dropped from rotation Wednesday,NO,Healthy,,,,,Galloway,Galloway (coach’s decision) didn’t see the floor in Wednesday’s 111-104 loss to the Heat.,"Galloway's ability to slide between both backcourt spots has kept him head coach Stan Van Gundy's rotation for much of the season, but it appears the 26-year-old's poor shooting since the beginning of December has prompted the Pistons bench boss to look in other directions for help at guard. With Avery Bradley (hip/groin) returning from a seven-game absence to start at shooting guard and playing 38 minutes in the contest, Luke Kennard acted as the top backup at the position, while two-way player Dwight Buycks served as the top understudy to starting point guard Ish Smith. Though it won't impact Galloway directly, the potential return of center Andre Drummond (rib) for Friday's game in Philadelphia will only leave fewer minutes to go around, so it's difficult to see Galloway reclaiming a role in the rotation unless Buycks or Kennard falter with the second unit.",1/04/2018 10:27:38 AM,204038,G,4,3702,DET,pistons,274590,1/04/2018 10:27:38 AM,langston_galloway

He is still expected to be on a minutes restriction for the next few games, however, so Jose Calderon, who started at point guard in 23 games for Cleveland this season, could still see some quality minutes off the bench while Thomas is still limited. Regardless, Thomas' presence will finally five the Cavaliers some stability at the point guard position that they've been craving for most of the season.",1/04/2018 10:23:31 AM,202738,G,2,3240,CLE,cavaliers,274589,1/04/2018 10:23:31 AM,isaiah_thomas

It appears the Pistons aren't counting on Jackson returning until the back end of that timetable, however, giving Ish Smith some added security in the starting role at point guard. Smith scored 18 points in both of his first two starts in place of Jackson, but was limited to six points on 3-of-10 shooting in Wednesday's 111-104 loss to the Heat while deferring more to backcourt mate Avery Bradley (hip/groin), who reentered the starting five following a seven-game absence.",1/04/2018 10:16:29 AM,202704,G,3,3217,DET,pistons,274588,1/04/2018 10:16:29 AM,reggie_jackson
6,1515096597,Reggie,Reggie Bullock: Expected to share starting role with Tolliver,NO,Healthy,,,,,Bullock,"Bullock started at small forward and generated 17 points (6-10 FG, 5-8 3Pt) and an assist across 35 minutes in Wednesday’s 111-104 win over the Heat.","The return of starting shooting guard Avery Bradley (groin) didn't result in a downturn in playing time for Bullock, who simply moved over to the other wing spot and split time at the position with Anthony Tolliver (20 minutes) and Luke Kennard (24 minutes). According to Dana Gauruder of the Detroit Free Press, head coach Stan Van Gundy said prior to Wednesday's game that the return of Bradley means that Bullock and Tolliver will share the starting small-forward role based on matchup. As such, when the Pistons are in need of more size to counter the opposition, Bullock seems more likely to surrender playing time, which could make his minutes volatile from game to game. In addition, the impending return of Stanley Johnson (hip) could also cut into the workload of all of the Pistons' wing options. Bullock, who is averaging 14.0 points (on 59.5 percent shooting) and 2.7 three-pointers over his past nine games, is probably still worth retaining in mid-sized or deeper leagues until his production takes a turn for the worse.",1/04/2018 10:09:57 AM,203493,G,3,3458,DET,pistons,274587,1/04/2018 10:09:57 AM,reggie_bullock

The young guard is in just his third NBA season and has improved each year. He has connected on 37.9-percent of his three-point attempts on 4.2 attempts per game, up from 31.8-percent on 2.4 attempts in the 2016-17 season. Rozier is a crucial part of Boston's backcourt rotation, but his fantasy value will be limited for as long as he is registering between 20 and 30 minutes of playing time on a nightly basis.",1/04/2018 10:05:55 AM,1626179,G,3,3736,BOS,celtics,274586,1/04/2018 10:05:55 AM,terry_rozier

He showcased his ability to affect the game in other ways, collecting a season-high nine rebounds, one short of a double-double. The game was in hand with plenty of time left on the clock which afforded Irving the opportunity to get some rest. He played less than 30 minutes for just the seventh time this season. The Celtics lead the league in games played due to a grueling first half schedule leading up to their trip to London. Look for Irving to be well-rested in the second half and continue building on his All-NBA caliber season.",1/04/2018 10:04:55 AM,202681,G,3,3186,BOS,celtics,274585,1/04/2018 10:04:55 AM,kyrie_irving

Bradley tied his season high in both minutes played and field-goal attempts, with the absence of high-usage center Andre Drummond (rib) playing a factor in the latter category. Drummond is a candidate to return as soon as Friday's game against the 76ers, so while Bradley shouldn't be expected to approach 20 shots again in that contest, the 27-year-old's two-way abilities should continue to earn him ample playing time so long as his groin cooperates.",1/04/2018 10:04:11 AM,202340,G,4,3112,DET,pistons,274584,1/04/2018 10:04:11 AM,avery_bradley

He didn't have much help on offense and buckets became tougher to come by once the Celtics started to shrink the floor and dare the other Cavs players to make shots. The 2017-18 version of James is a force to be reckoned with, similar to 2016-17 version, and the 2015-16 version, and the 2014-15 version, and so on. It's tough to imagine that James can improve on his 27.5 points / 8.1 rebounds / 9.1 assists averages, but the addition of a healthy Isaiah Thomas might just do the trick as we transition into the second half.",1/04/2018 10:03:46 AM,2544,F,3,2344,CLE,cavaliers,274583,1/04/2018 10:03:46 AM,lebron_james

Halfway through his 14th NBA season, Korver continues to knock down three-pointers with insane efficiency. Spacing hasn't been an issue for this Cavs team and it should only be getting better when Isaiah Thomas returns to the lineup for good.",1/04/2018 10:02:57 AM,2594,G,3,2400,CLE,cavaliers,274582,1/04/2018 10:02:57 AM,kyle_korver

Johnson doesn't appear in any immediate risk of a long-term absence, but Kennard won't fall out of the rotation completely once the former is back in action. However, Kennard is likely to see his minutes drop back in the teens at that time, which would limit his opportunities to provide consistent scoring and 3-point production.",1/04/2018 9:59:38 AM,1628379,G,4,4123,DET,pistons,274581,1/04/2018 9:59:38 AM,

The Knicks have lost six of their last seven contests, with star Kristaps Porzingis noting following Wednesday's loss to the Wizards that he's feeling the effects of the increased workload in the wake of Hardaway's absence. If he gets the green light to run Saturday, Hardaway could resume practicing soon after, which would set the stage for his return to game action later this month.

He'll have another few days off for rest and rehabilitation ahead of Saturday's contest, though the Pacers will likely want to see how his knee responds following a full practice, so that's something to keep an eye moving forward. For now, consider Oladipo questionable going into Saturday's contest and if he were to be cleared, Lance Stephenson would head back to the bench and see a significant decrease in his overall workload.",1/04/2018 9:34:51 AM,203506,G,2,3433,IND,pacers,274579,1/04/2018 9:34:51 AM,victor_oladipo

That said, it's still encouraging that Conley was able to do some contact work and he finally appears to be nearing the latter stages of his recovery after missing the last month and a half of action. It seems highly unlikely he'd be back in time for Friday's game against the Wizards and until another update is provided, Conley should still be considered out moving forward.",1/04/2018 9:19:14 AM,201144,G,2,2813,MEM,grizzlies,274578,1/04/2018 9:19:14 AM,mike_conley

Factoring in Wednesday's contest, he's logged between 15 and 31 minutes in the last four games, as well as double-digit tallies in six of his last nine overall. He's now posted back-to-back double-digit scoring efforts for the first time this season as well, numbers that have been partly enabled by a 56.0 percent success rate from the field over his last four contests.

He's still two weeks from upping his participation and it's unclear when exactly he'll be cleared for full contact practices. Either way, the Mavericks are expecting to be without him for at least another month, so fantasy owners can continue to avoid the situation.

Johnson has been seeing steady playing time since returning from a long layoff due to a wrist injury on Dec. 15, but Wednesday marked only the third time during that span that he posted a double-digit point total.

We’re in a tough stretch. The mental part doesn’t help at all. When it’s mentally tough, you don’t have it in you.”","Porzingis' diminished effectiveness the last few games would seemingly support the idea that he's exhausted, as he was limited to just 16 points on 5-for-13 shooting -- including only two points in the second half -- on Wednesday.

That production shouldn't result in season-long owners removing Porzingis from their lineup, but the 22-year-old doesn't look like an especially strong option in daily formats at the moment.

The nine-year veteran has now shot at least 45.5 percent in four straight contests while draining multiple three-pointers in each. The recent success has helped Holiday's shooting percentage on the season climb to a career-best 49.4 percent, a figure he's attained while putting up his highest number of attempts (14.7) since the 2012-13 campaign.",1/04/2018 6:14:19 AM,201950,G,3,3029,NOP,pelicans,274555,1/04/2018 6:14:19 AM,jrue_holiday

He was projected to be sidelined for 4-to-6 weeks after receiving a second opinion following the injection, but with the low end of that timetable having come to pass and Leuer having yet to make notable progress, it's looking likely that surgical intervention may be necessary.

It's safe to say that the 19-year-old made the most of the first extended minutes of his career, as he lit it up from beyond the arc and provided a few electrifying dunks while scoring all of his points in the second half.

Prior to the injury, Ojeleye had seen less than 20 minutes in five straight games, so he still shouldn't be relied upon for fantasy purposes despite being at full strength. He'll continue to serve as a depth option on the wing.",1/03/2018 1:11:32 PM,1628400,F,3,4175,BOS,celtics,274474,1/03/2018 1:11:32 PM,

Look for a final word on his availability following warmups, though as it currently stands, Johnson should be back in the lineup barring any last second setback. That said, there's a chance he has his minutes limited a bit and coach Erik Spoelstra already indicated that Kelly Olynyk would remain the starting power forward Wednesday, so Johnson will likely have to settle for a bench role.",1/03/2018 1:01:14 PM,201949,F,3,3021,MIA,heat,274472,1/03/2018 1:01:14 PM,james_johnson

The 25-year-old is coming off of one of his best performances of the season Saturday in Orlando, when he scored 31 points to go with four rebounds and three assists. With Dion Waiters battling an ankle injury, Johnson has seen at least 33 minutes in six of Miami's last seven contests.",1/03/2018 12:58:40 PM,204020,G,3,3685,MIA,heat,274471,1/03/2018 12:58:40 PM,tyler_johnson

That means Murray will pick up the start and should see extended playing time. The last time Parker was out for rest, Murray logged 27 minutes, which is likely similar to what he'll see Wednesday.

The last two times Chandler rested, Monroe played 27 and 30 minutes, respectively, splitting time up front with Alex Len. In a win over Memphis on Dec. 21, Monroe had eight points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. And in a loss to the Raptors on Dec. 13, the veteran finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds.",1/03/2018 12:52:24 PM,202328,C,3,3108,PHX,suns,274468,1/03/2018 12:52:24 PM,greg_monroe

That'll make him a potential punt-play for Wednesday's DFS slate, though the majority of the aforementioned players should be back Friday, so it'll only be a temporary uptick in value for Anderson.",1/03/2018 12:51:50 PM,203937,F,3,3586,SAS,spurs,274467,1/03/2018 12:51:50 PM,kyle_anderson

Along with Green, coach Gregg Popovich is also resting Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard and Manu Ginobili, so there should be a ton of minutes of available for Forbes. He can be considered a punt-play for DFS purposes Wednesday, though he could potentially pick up a few more starts as well if Green isn't healthy enough to return by the end of this week.",1/03/2018 12:47:53 PM,1627854,G,3,3961,SAS,spurs,274466,1/03/2018 12:47:53 PM,bryn_forbes
