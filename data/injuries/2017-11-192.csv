However, after playing just two games, he's reportedly dealing with a flare up of that previous quad injury and will now miss a second straight game.

However, it appears he may have picked up a shoulder injury during Saturday's game against the Rockets and is now in danger of being sidelined for the first time this season.

The Pistons are actually slated to have Leuer undergo another MRI in the near future as well just to make sure there's nothing more serious at hand, which is at least somewhat concerning.

That said, Muscala is nearing a return to full strength and if all goes as planned, he should be available to play once again on Monday considering his probable designation.

He'll be placed on the injury report once again ahead of Monday's contest, but it appears to be just precautionary and he should take the court as usual.

After averaging just 10.1 minutes so far this season, Casspi should see a sizable increase in his workload Sunday, giving him punt-play potential for Sunday's DFS slate. Still, with guys like Andre Iguodala and Patrick McCaw also available to help soak up Durant's minutes, it could be more of a committee approach than anything.",11/19/2017 11:43:13 AM,201956,F,3,2987,GSW,warriors,270239,11/19/2017 11:43:13 AM,omri_casspi

However, it clearly wasn't anything overly serious, as Lamb is fully expected to take the court come Monday's matchup with the Timberwolves.

He's appeared in four games this season for the Hawks, averaging 2.5 minutes.

He ended taking part in two G-League games over the last week, averaging 3.0 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0 steal and 1.0 block across 15.9 minutes. He appears to have avoided any sort of setbacks with the quad and will now have a chance to make his season debut with the big club on Monday vs. the Spurs.
