The extent of the surgery is unclear at this point in time and the Nuggets aren't offering any sort of timetable for a return, so Millsap is going to be considered out indefinitely for the time being. A more concrete target date will likely be released following the surgery, but it wouldn't be surprising if he missed at least a month or two of action. Guys like Kenneth Faried, Juan Hernangomez and Trey Lyles should help cover his minutes, with Faried the likely starter moving forward.

That said, he's still yet to touch double-digit minutes, so another stint in the G-League will give him an opportunity to see extended playing time. Either way, the 2017-18 campaign is expected to be a developmental one for Qi, so he's someone that can be avoided in fantasy moving forward.",11/21/2017 12:35:58 PM,1627753,C,4,3893,HOU,rockets,270438,11/21/2017 12:35:58 PM,zhou_qi

As long as I’m progressing and I’m doing what I need to on the court, this thing could go fast and I could be out there playing with the guys. My jumping and my athleticism are good. All my strength numbers are there. [I’ve] been out of basketball — contact wise — for nine months, and that’s not going to come back in two or three practices. I have to get my timing down. I’ve been doing everything from dunking to running. Only thing I hadn’t been cleared for was contact. I’ve been pushing it as much as I can.”","Despite offering up the mid-to-late December timetable, LaVine nor the Bulls have given any firm indication that the date for his return is locked in stone, as the guard acknowledged that he could be cleared to play before or after that projection based on how he feels in his subsequent practices. Regardless, the fact that LaVine made it through his first contact work without incident is a positive sign, and adds fuel to the notion that his return to game action may be imminent. The centerpiece in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves this offseason, LaVine could eventually settle in as the Bulls' go-to scorer, though he may need a few weeks to find his form following the long layoff due to a major operation.
